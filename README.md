# UA Innovate Spring 2022
UA Innovate is a female-led Hackathon and Innovation Challenge held at the University of Alabama. This was the first of its kind. I joined the Data Analytics category and participated in the data science track where my team and I developed a ML model that predicts the energy efficiency of a building given different inputs. This repository is what we submitted!
